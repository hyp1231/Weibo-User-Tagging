## Datasets

We have collected a large microblogging dataset from [SINA Weibo](https://weibo.com). We start with several users with a large number of inlinks (followers) or outlinks (followings) as seed users, and gradually extend the user set according their links. We crawl the tweets, profile, following links for these users. In the extension process, following [Ee-Peng Lim et.al.](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1871437.1871557), we use a series of simplified heuristic methods to filter the inactive or spam users:

* we remove the accounts who have published no more than three tweets;
* we remove the accounts who have no more than five followers;
* we remove the accounts who have published a large number of tweets in a short period (twenty tweets per day);
* we remove the accounts who have added advertisement keywords or e-commerce links in their tags, profiles and nicknames (e.g. company);
* we remove the accounts who have not published a tweet in recent month at crawl date;
* we remove the accounts who have published many very similar tweets;
* we remove the accounts who have a large number of retweets but very few original tweets.

We also remove unfrequent tags that are used by fewer than 100 users. We present the basic statistics of the final dataset in the following table.

The tag set is generated by merging the tags frequently adopted by the users. For privacy problem, we anonymized all users and tags by mapping them into random IDs.
